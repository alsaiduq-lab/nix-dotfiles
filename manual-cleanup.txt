# Commands for cleaning up Nix system because I'm tired of looking these up:

nix-env --list-generations

# Perform garbage collection by deleting old derivations
nix-collect-garbage --delete-old

# recommeneded to sometimes run as sudo to collect additional garbage
sudo nix-collect-garbage -d

# As a separation of concerns - you will need to run this command to clean out boot
sudo /run/current-system/bin/switch-to-configuration boot

# bonus: in case you're stuck in some limbo state
sudo /run/current-system/sw/bin/nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
